# PROJECT NAME: NEWS EXPLORER

##

### **`DESCRIPTION:`**

### Welcome! I am proud to present to you my custom enhanced version of News Explorer! This project comes from a design located [here](https://www.figma.com/design/3ottwMEhlBt95Dbn8dw1NH/Your-Final-Project?node-id=0-1). Since we had an option to pursue a custom design, I figured I could take the minimum requirement and enhance it to my own liking! There are quite a few components and additional functionalities not attributed to the requirements of the original News Explorer project, including such details like:

### - a readout of the local weather that can be clicked to open a modal with more details including a 6 day forecast

### - stock prices Bitcoin, Etherium, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon

### - a news ticker streaming 550 articles pulled when the site opens

### - a search on the main page that calls information from three api's with an emphasis on NewsApp

### - a "Liked by server" section where users can like something, it gets stored to the server, and others can see it was liked

### - and a "Saved articles" section where users can favorite items privately and keep a list associated with their account

### **`TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES:`**

### This frontend application was created using a variety languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.JS with an emphasis on React.JS as this project is to highlight its features. Npm and Vite is also utilized to assist development and deployment. The project has 8 different API's and is referenced on the live site. The backend uses Express, Mongoose, CORS, bcrypt, Celebrate, and Node. The server is a Google server with a Ubuntu OS utilizing Nginx, Certbot, Mongo, and Node.

### **`DEPLOYMENT:`**

### This website can be accessed at the following link: (https://www.newsexplorer.justlearning.net/). Note, some service providers might block this because justlearning.net is a public domain, which could be used by hackers to create ficticious sites and attack people. On Spectrum, I had to temporarily turn off the Security Shield.

### Both the frontend and backend files can be accessed here (https://github.com/BigRedCoding/FinalProject). These can be downloaded and ran locally. When you're in VS Code, using "npm install" for dependecies and "npm run dev" on both should allow local use.

### **`Video Demonstration:`**

### For the moment, I will wait on this until the project is accepted by reviewers, then I'll create the video.
