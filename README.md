# PROJECT NAME: THE PLANET PLEDGE

##

### **`DESCRIPTION:`**

### Welcome! We are pleased to present our rendition of this project called "The Planet Pledge." This is a fun website that gives users the opportunity to view pledges made by others that can help the planet, post their own pledges they'd like to commit to (with a mock-input for submitting their email to help remind them of their pledge), take a quiz to check how planet-conscious their current actions are, and access other resources that revolve around assisting proactive proplanet actions!

### **`TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES:`**

### This frontend application was created using a variety languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.JS with an emphasis on React.JS as this project is to highlight its features. Npm and Vite is also utilized to assist development and deployment.The backend uses Express, Mongoose, CORS, bcrypt, Celebrate, and Node. The server is a Google server with a Ubuntu OS utilizing Nginx, Certbot, Mongo, and Node.

### **`DEPLOYMENT:`**

### This website can be accessed at the following link: (https://www.theplanetpledge.justlearning.net). Note, some service providers might block this because justlearning.net is a public domain, which could be used by hackers to create ficticious sites and attack people. On Spectrum, I had to temporarily turn off the Security Shield.

### Both the frontend and backend files can be accessed here (https://github.com/BigRedCoding/theplanetpledge). These can be downloaded and ran locally. When you're in VS Code, using "npm install" for dependecies and "npm run dev" on both should allow local use.

### Group design input is posted here (https://github.com/hmperry/code_jam_march_2025)
